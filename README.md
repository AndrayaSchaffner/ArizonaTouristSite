I built a tourist site in HTML grid and styled with CSS that has a clickable image link to another page. It gives some facts about Arizona, and some natural wonders to see. It also has an opption to enter your contact info for more information about Arizona.

I used HTML and CSS to create and style this page.

I had a little bit of help from senior developer Wuori and Senior developer Valdez.
